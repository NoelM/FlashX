Compute eigenvalues/vectors on a symmetric matrix.

Description:

     This method reimplements implicitly restarted Lanczos method to
     compute eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The method is implemented
     completely in R and follows the implementation of ARPACK library.

Usage:

     fm.arpack(A.multiply, n, k, m, which, tol)
     
Arguments:

A.multiply: the function to perform matrix vector multiplication.

       n: Numeric scalar. The dimension of the eigenproblem.

       k: Numeric scalar. The number of eigenvalues to be computed.

       m: Number of Lanczos vectors to be generated.

   which: Specify which eigenvalues/vectors to compute, character
          constant with exactly two characters. Possible values for
          symmetric input matrices: "LA" Compute "nev" largest
          (algebraic) eigenvalues. "SA" Compute "nev" smallest
          (algebraic) eigenvalues. "LM" Compute "nev" largest (in
          magnitude) eigenvalues. "SM" Compute "nev" smallest (in
          magnitude) eigenvalues.

 Numeric: scalar. Stopping criterion: the relative accuracy of the Ritz
          value is considered acceptable if its error is less than
          'tol' times its estimated value. If this is set to zero then
          machine precision is used.
