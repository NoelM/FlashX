The basic operators supported by FlashMatrixR.

Description:

     The basic operators are mainly used by the FlashMatrixR functions
     that accept operators as arguments. Such a function includes
     `fm.mapply', `fm.inner.prod', etc.

Usage:

     fm.get.basic.op(name)
     
     fm.get.basic.uop(name)
     
     fm.init.basic.op()
     
Arguments:

    name: the name of the basic operator.

Details:

     `fm.get.basic.op' gets the predefined basic binary operator
     specified by a user.

     `fm.get.basic.uop' gets the predefined basic unary operator
     specified by a user.

     `fm.init.basic.op' defines the basic operators.

     `fm.bo.add' is the predifined basic binary operator for addition.
     `fm.bo.sub' is the predifined basic binary operator for
     subtraction. `fm.bo.mul' is the predifined basic binary operator
     for multiplication. `fm.bo.div' is the predifined basic binary
     operator for division. `fm.bo.min' is the predifined basic binary
     operator for computing minimum. `fm.bo.max' is the predifined
     basic binary operator for computing maximum. `fm.bo.pow' is the
     predifined basic binary operator for computing exponential.
     `fm.bo.eq', `fm.bo.gt' and `fm.bo.ge' are the predefined basic
     logical operators to compare two elements: ==, >, >=.

     `fm.buo.neg' is the predefined basic unary operator for negate.
     `fm.buo.sqrt' is the predefined basic unary operator for square
     root. `fm.buo.abs' is the predefined basic unary operator for
     absolute value. `fm.buo.not' is the predefined logical NOT
     Operator. `fm.buo.ceil' is the predefined basic unary Operator of
     computing a ceiling of a number. `fm.buo.floor' is the predefined
     basic unary Operator of computing a floor of a number.

Value:

     a reference to the specified basic operator.
