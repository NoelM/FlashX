Spectral embedding

Description:

     This computes spectral embedding of a given graph. It supports
     four variants:

Usage:

     fm.ASE(fm, num.eigen, which = c("A, Aug, L, nL"),
       which.eigen = c("LM, LA, SM, SA"), c = 1, tol = 1e-12)
     
Arguments:

      fm: The FlashMatrixR object

num.eigen: The number of eigenvalues/vectors required.

   which: The type of the embedding.

which.eigen: Specify which eigenvalues/vectors to compute, character
          constant with exactly two characters.

       c: The constant used in the Aug variant of embedding.

     tol: Numeric scalar. Stopping criterion: the relative accuracy of
          the Ritz value is considered acceptable if its error is less
          than tol times its estimated value. If this is set to zero
          then machine precision is used.

     tau: The value used in the regularized Laplacian embedding.

Details:

     Adjacency matrix (A),

     Augmented matrix (Aug), A - c * D, where c is a constant provided
     by a user.

     Laplacian matrix (L), L = D - A,

     Normalized Laplacian matrix (nL), nL = I - D^(-1/2) * A * D^(-1/2)

     For the Laplacian matrix and the normalized Laplacian matrix, this
     function only accepts a symmetric sparse matrix.

Value:

     A named list with the following members:

     values

     Numeric vector, the desired eigenvalues.

     vectors

     Numeric matrix, the desired eigenvectors as columns. If
     complex=TRUE (the default for non-symmetric problems), then the
     matrix is complex.

     options

     A named list with the supplied options and some information about
     the performed calculation, including an ARPACK exit code.
