Groupby on a FlashMatrixR vector.

Description:

     `fm.sgroupby' groups elements in a vector based on corresponding
     `labels' and applies `FUN' to the elements in each group. `FUN' is
     an aggregation operator.

Usage:

     fm.sgroupby(obj, FUN)
     
Arguments:

     obj: a FlashMatrixR vector or matrix

     FUN: an aggregation operator returned by `fm.get.basic.op'.

  margin: the subscript which the function will be applied over. E.g.,
          for a matrix, `1' indicates rows, `2' indicates columns.

  labels: a FlashMatrixR vector that indicates the labels of each
          element in `obj'.

Details:

     `fm.groupby' groups rows/columns of a matrix based on
     corresponding `labels' and applies `FUN' to the rows/columns in
     each group. `FUN' is an aggregation operator.

Value:

     `fm.sgroupby' returns a data frame, where the column `val' stores
     all of the unique values in the original data container, and the
     column `agg' stores the aggregate result of the corresponding
     value.
