Get a submatrix composed of some columns from a FlashMatrixR matrix

Description:

     This only works on a column-wise matrix. The submatrix is also
     organized column-wise. The submatrix shares the same data as the
     input matrix, so there is no memory copy.

Usage:

     fm.get.cols(fm, idxs)
     
Arguments:

      fm: A FlashMatrixR matrix

    idxs: an array of column indices in fm.

Value:

     a submatrix
