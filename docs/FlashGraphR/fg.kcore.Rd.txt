K-core decomposition of a graph.

Description:

     The k-core of graph is a maximal subgraph in which each vertex has
     at least degree k. A vertex belongs to the k-th core if has degree
     >= k when all connected vertices with degree < k are recursively
     deleted.

Usage:

     fg.kcore(graph, k.start = 2, k.end = 10)
     
Arguments:

   graph: The FlashGraphR object

 k.start: The lowest core that should be computed. Must be >= 2.

   k.end: The highest core that should be computed. Must be >= 2.
          default is 10.

Value:

     A numeric vector that contains the core of each vertex up to
     `k.end`. Vertices in cores higher than `k.end` will have entries
     with `-1` as their core.
