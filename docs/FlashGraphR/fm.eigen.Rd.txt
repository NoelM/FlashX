Eigensolver

Description:

     Compute eigenvalues/vectors of the adjacency matrix of an
     undirected graph.

Usage:

     fm.eigen(func, extra = NULL, sym = FALSE, options = fm.eigen.default,
       env = parent.frame())
     
Arguments:

    func: The function to perform the matrix-vector multiplication.

   extra: Extra argument to supply to `func'.

     sym: Logical scalar, whether the input matrix is symmetric.

 options: Options to Anasazi.

          The `options' argument specifies what kind of computation to
          perform. It is a list with the following members, which
          correspond directly to Anasazi parameters:

          which Specify which eigenvalues/vectors to compute, character
          constant with exactly two characters. Possible values for
          symmetric input matrices: "LA' Compute 'nev' largest
          (algebraic) eigenvalues. "SA" Compute "nev" smallest
          (algebraic) eigenvalues. "LM" Compute `nev' largest (in
          magnitude) eigenvalues. "SM" Compute `nev' smallest (in
          magnitude) eigenvalues. nev Numeric scalar. The number of
          eigenvalues to be computed. ncv Number of Lanczos vectors to
          be generated.

Details:

     This eigensolver is powered by Anasazi package of Trilinos.

Value:

     A named list with the following members: values: Numeric vector,
     the desired eigenvalues.  vectors: Numeric matrix, the desired
     eigenvectors as columns.
