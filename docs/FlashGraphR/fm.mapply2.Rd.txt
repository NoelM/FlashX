Apply a Function to two FlashMatrixR vectors/matrices.

Description:

     `mapply' applies `FUN' to the first elements of each vector, the
     second elements, the third elements, and so on. Two
     vectors/matrices should have the same shape. Currently, `mapply'
     only accepts predefined basic operators returned by
     `fm.get.basic.op'.

Usage:

     fm.mapply2(o1, o2, FUN)
     
Arguments:

     o1,: o2 a FlashMatrixR vector/matrix.

     FUN: the user-defined operators.

Value:

     a FlashMatrixR vector/matrix.
