Perform k-means clustering on a data matrix.

Description:

     Assign each row of a matrix to a cluster denoted by a numeric. The
     clusters are based on the euclidean distance of each row to one
     another. The assigned cluster will have the smallest distance from
     the cluster center mean.

Usage:

     fg.kmeans(mat, k, max.iters = 10, max.threads = 256, init = c("random",
       "forgy", "kmeanspp"), tol = -1)
     
Arguments:

     mat: A numeric matrix of data.

       k: The number of clusters.

max.iters: The maximum number of iterations allowed.

max.threads: The maximum number of threads allowed (Default is 1 per
          core).

    init: The form of initialization to use when the algorithm begins.
          The default is "random". For a desciption of each see:
          http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering#Initialization_methods.

     tol: The tolerance for convergence. Between 0 and 1 and is the
          minimum fraction of cluster changes necessary to cause
          non-convergence. Default is -1 which represents no cluster
          changes.

Value:

     A named list with the following members: iters: The number of
     (outer) iterations performed.  centers: A matrix of cluster
     centers.  cluster: A vector of integers (from 1:k) indicating the
     cluster to which each point is allocated.  sizes: The number of
     points in each cluster.

     mat <- replicate(5, rnorm(10))
     kms <- fg.kmeans(mat, num.clusts)
