Vertex betweenness centrality.

Description:

     The vertex betweenness centrality can be defined as the number of
     geodesics (shortest paths) going through a vertex.

Usage:

     fg.betweenness(fg, vids = 0:(fg$vcount - 1))
     
Arguments:

      fg: The FlashGraphR object.

    vids: A vector of vertex IDs. Default runs it on the entire graph.

Value:

     A vector with betweenness centrality values for all vertices with
     respect to `vids`.

Examples:

     fg <- fg.load.graph("edge_list.txt")
     res <- fg.betweenness(fg, c(1,10))
