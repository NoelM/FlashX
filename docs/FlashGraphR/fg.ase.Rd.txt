Spectral embedding

Description:

     This computes spectral embedding of a given graph.

Usage:

     fg.ASE.igraph(fg, num.eigen, which = c("A, AcD, L, nL, nL_tau"),
       which.eigen = c("LM, LA, SM, SA"), c = 1, tau = 1, tol = 1e-12)
     
Arguments:

      fg: The FlashGraphR object

num.eigen: The number of eigenvalues/vectors required.

   which: The type of the embedding.

which.eigen: Specify which eigenvalues/vectors to compute, character
          constant with exactly two characters.

       c: The constant used in the AcD variant of embedding.

     tau: The value used in the regularized Laplacian embedding.

     tol: Numeric scalar. Stopping criterion: the relative accuracy of
          the Ritz value is considered acceptable if its error is less
          than tol times its estimated value. If this is set to zero
          then machine precision is used.

Details:

     It supports five variants.

     Adjacency matrix (A),

     A - c * D (AcD), where c is a constant provided by a user.

     Laplacian matrix (L), L = D - A,

     Normalized Laplacian matrix (nL), nL = I - D^(-1/2) * A * D^(-1/2)

     Regularized Laplacian matrix (nL_tau), nL_tau = D_tau^(-1/2) A
     D_tau^(-1/2)

Value:

     A named list with the following members:

     values

     Numeric vector, the desired eigenvalues.

     vectors

     Numeric matrix, the desired eigenvectors as columns. If
     complex=TRUE (the default for non-symmetric problems), then the
     matrix is complex.

     options

     A named list with the supplied options and some information about
     the performed calculation, including an ARPACK exit code.
