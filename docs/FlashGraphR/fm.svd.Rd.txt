Compute the singular-value decomposition of a large sparse matrix.

Description:

     Compute the singular-value decomposition of a large sparse matrix.

Usage:

     fm.svd(x, nu, nv, tol = 1e-08)
     
Arguments:

       x: a FlashMatrixR object

      nu: the number of left singluar vectors to be computed.

      nv: the number of right singluar vectors to be computed.

     tol: Stopping criterion: the relative accuracy of the Ritz value
          is considered acceptable if its error is less than 'tol'
          times its estimated value. If this is set to zero then
          machine precision is used.

Value:

     Returns a list with three entries

        • d max(nu, nv) approximate singular values

        • u nu approximate left singular vectors (only when
          right_only=FALSE)

        • v nv approximate right singular vectors
